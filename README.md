## Purpose
This branch is a direct replica of the main branch, mostly. Here everything is in Json tree structures. This is used for the router program as getting these json files is way simpler than trying to work around the API.

This branch is separate from the main branch to allow quick update to the listings without causing many pull / push issues.
