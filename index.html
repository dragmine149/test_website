			Welcome to the test suite. This is a "sub-site". The purpose of this repo is a place to link together multiple other repos for testing purposes, where a server is needed
			but it ain't worth updating the main site for.
			<br>
			Everything here acts like a router. Due to lack of server-side code, javscript will download and replace the page automatically upon selecting something. A UI will be appended
			ontop of anything that does change so that you can switch back.
			<br>
			Please note, this is designed to test stuff and share stuff for others to test. If you got here by accident, please turn back about now this could get very confusing otherwise.
			<br>
			Note: Everything here is just a dirty temporary setup. It will be improved in the future.
